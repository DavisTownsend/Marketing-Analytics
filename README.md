#Fish preferences
This is the first homework assignment for Marketing Analytics which builds a binomial logit model from scratch and looks at how market shares change when prices change

#ATX Outwear
This is the second homework assignment and walks through an RFM analysis and shows why a targeted RFM approach is better than random selection of customers to mail to. At the end of the report I also consider some of the pitfalls of relying solely on an RFM approach to sending out mailings.
